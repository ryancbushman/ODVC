# do I need to provided a minimum N for the use of these asymptotic variance
# functions?

# write function for user to create their own dataset of either balanced or unbalanced designs
# allow it to interact with existing functions

# given tau, what are the N and a combo that provide diminishing returns on increased sample size

# Thoughts on compare tool for unbalanced design, allow user to specify top x
# number of designs to compare, create similar dashboard. Recommend max of 4
# designs. Perhaps allow them to choose designs by row number.

# scatter plot instead of bar chart


# For the efficiency vs N plot, relative efficiency is calculated with respect
# to what? If it is the whole dataset then seems unhelpful.

# look into confidence intervals on variance components and the eigenvalue min max decomposition of infomat

# STANDARDIZE ARGUMENTS ACROSS FUNCTIONS, I.E. A OR G FOR GROUPS

# print both scores on plot design, eliminate criteria argument

# I can only have one function for the 3vc 2vc case if instead of partitions, I allow the user to specify
# how they would allocate reps.
