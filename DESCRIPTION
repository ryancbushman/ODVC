Description: This package allows a user to compare designs from catalogs of both 
    balanced and unbalanced experiments from models in which the variance 
    components are the effects of interst. These experiments are scored on both 
    the 'A' and 'D' criteria. The user can generate contour plots that allow 
    them to compare designs of various parameter selections such that they can 
    choose the most quality cost effective design
