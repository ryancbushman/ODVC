Description: This package includes tools that allow users to do optimal design 
  of experiments for balanced and unbalanced one-way and two-way nested random 
  effects models. Optimal design for random effects is inherently different than 
  optimal design for fixed effects. The information matrix for a random effects 
  model is a function of the experiment's sample sizes and variance components. 
  Rather than using an optimization algorithm to explore the parameter space, 
  one must generate all designs (or a tractable subset of designs) as a function 
  of the parameters and score them to find the optimal design. The tools 
  provided are capable of generating datasets of designs, scoring the designs on
  both the "A" and "D" criteria, and calculating relative efficiency. The 
  datasets generated make it easy to find the optimal design and comparably well
  performing designs. The tools provided allow the user to explore how the 
  optimal design changes based on the hypothesized (or rarely but ideally known)
  values of the variance components. There are also valuable visualization tools
  designed to help create figures for publication or research purposes.
